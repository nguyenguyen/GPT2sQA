As for my own thoughts they may be given in a few words they were upon the vanity of human wishes. Whatever i had done with the one object i had in view whatever might have been my success had i lived whether i might have been wedded to Minnie some future day or what may have resulted good bad or indifferent as to future all was to be in a few hours cut short by the will of Heaven. i did so again and again until the night wore away and tired out at last i fell fast asleep. The next day after i had been on board of the schooner and given my orders to Bob Cross i returned to Mr Fraser and sat down to write to Mr Vanderwelt i also wrote to Minnie which i had never done before. i did so again and again until the night wore away and tired out at last i fell fast asleep. The next day after i had been on board of the schooner and given my orders to Bob Cross i returned to Mr Fraser and sat down to write to Mr Vanderwelt i also wrote to Minnie which i had never done before. Shortly afterwards we went to bed. i must say his description of Minnie which was even much more in detail than i have narrated to the reader did prevent my going to sleep for a long while. Women as the reader may have seen never once troubled my thoughts. i thought that the week would never expire but like all other weeks it died a natural death at last and we were united. The fete was over the company had all left us and we were again alone and i held my dearest Minnie in my arms when Mr Vanderwelt brought me in a letter from England. It was from Mr Warden and i hastily opened it. Minnie shared my impatience and read over my shoulder. The contents were as follows. my dear captain keene. i could not sleep last night Minnie and it was all your fault. My fault. Yes your fault for i could not sleep for thinking of you i thought you were looking at me as you do now the whole night. Minnie blushed and i kissed her hand. As soon as my wound was dressed i requested writing materials and wrote to the Admiralty giving an account of what had occurred since i quitted Heligoland. i had written to inform them of the loss of the frigate when i was on the island. If you knew how delighted i am to see you and be able to express my thanks said Mynheer Vanderwelt and poor Minnie too. How often have we talked over that dreadful day and wondered if ever we should see you again. i assure you on my honour that now i no longer regret the capture of the island. Minnie stood by me during the time her father was speaking her large blue eyes beaming through the tears with which they brimmed and as i turned to her our eyes met and she smiled. He had often heard the history of my saving their lives on board of the pirate vessel from Mr Vanderwelt who made it a constant theme of his discourse and added Mr Fraser You do not know what a regard he has for you. And little Minnie sir. inquired i it is now nearly five years since i saw her. Little Minnie is no longer little Minnie Mr Keene i can assure you. She was fifteen when she left the island and had grown a tall and very beautiful girl. And you wo not go to sea any more will you Percival. said Minnie. They wo not give me a ship Minnie after having lost the one i commanded to be unfortunate is to be guilty in those who have no interest. I'm very glad to hear it then you will remain quietly on shore and you will come and see us.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "A Heiress"}], "question": "Who was Minnie", "id": "0029bdbe75423337b551e42bb31f9a102785376f28"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": -1, "text": "Daughter to the dutch merchant"}], "question": "Who was Minnie", "id": "0029bdbe75423337b551e42bb31f9a102785376f28"}]}]}]}
